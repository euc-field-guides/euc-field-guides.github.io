# The Journey Begins

And so it starts... This first post covers some high level ideas on how to start learning and playing with Energy and Utilities Cloud. The easiest starting point is to sign up for a [trial org](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=ind.Get_an_Energy__Utilities_Cloud_Base_Trial_Org.htm&type=5) and get cracking!

## The road less traveled

If you are looking at learning a bit of DevOps another approach is to set up a Dev Hub, spin up scratch orgs and install the Vlocity CMT package. Once that is done more and more config can start to be added. 

For example:

- Sample data
- Post install config
- Initial CPQ configuration and lwc cart
- Express Apps
- Features
  - Business Rules Engine
  - Actionable Relationship Center
  - etc

The path for building up scratch orgs will be covered under the 'Uphill' category.

##Â Tradeoffs

While Trial orgs are fully configured they do expire. On the other hand scratch orgs definitely expire but allow you to keep your config as code. Code lasts forever(ish).

Of course you could also add config to a trial org and export it as metadata, but where's the fun in that...
