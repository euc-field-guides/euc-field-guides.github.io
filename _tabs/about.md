This is a gathering point for articles, tips, how to guides and opinions on Energy & Utilities Cloud.

All repo's should be in a deployable format. Either an [sf project](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_project_commands_unified.htm#cli_reference_project_generate_unified) or a [Vlocity Build Tool project](https://github.com/vlocityinc/vlocity_build).
