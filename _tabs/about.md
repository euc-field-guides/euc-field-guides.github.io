# Field Guides

This is a gethering point for articles, tips, how to guides and opinions on Energy & Utilities Cloud. Where possible the article / post should include all the framing / explanation required and any code should be stored in a repo associaced with this [org]([https://](https://github.com/orgs/euc-field-guides/repositories)).

All repo's should be in a deployable format. Either an [sf project]([https://](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_cli_reference.meta/sfdx_cli_reference/cli_reference_project_commands_unified.htm#cli_reference_project_generate_unified)) or a [Vlocity Build Tool project]([https://](https://github.com/vlocityinc/vlocity_build)).
